Here are the primary techniques used for training Large Language Models (LLMs), along with detailed explanations to help you articulate these clearly during your interview:

---

## 1. **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)**

**Description**:

* Models are trained on massive text corpora without explicit labels.
* The model learns by predicting masked words or the next token in a sequence.

**Techniques**:

* **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**:
  Predict masked words within sentences (e.g., BERT).
* **Causal Language Modeling (CLM)**:
  Predict next word/token given previous context (e.g., GPT-series models).

**Examples**:

* GPT-3, GPT-4, LLaMA, BERT, RoBERTa.

---

## 2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**

**Description**:

* Training the pre-trained LLM further on smaller, labeled datasets.
* Typically task-specific (classification, sentiment analysis, translation).

**Techniques**:

* Fine-tune using labeled data, typically through supervised cross-entropy loss.
* Adjusts model parameters slightly, retaining most of the original knowledge.

**Examples**:

* Fine-tuning BERT for sentiment analysis.
* Fine-tuning GPT models for chat applications.

---

## 3. **Instruction-Tuning**

**Description**:

* Specialized form of supervised fine-tuning.
* Train the LLM explicitly on pairs of instructions and expected outputs, teaching the model how to follow human-like instructions.

**Techniques**:

* Instruction datasets typically include prompt-response pairs.
* Ensures model outputs are coherent and instruction-aligned.

**Examples**:

* GPT-3.5 Turbo, ChatGPT, and other instruction-tuned chatbots.
* Alpaca (instruction-tuned LLaMA).

---

## 4. **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**

**Description**:

* Uses reinforcement learning methods guided by human preferences to further align model outputs with human values and expectations.

**Techniques**:

* Collect human ratings on multiple outputs.
* Train a reward model using these ratings.
* Optimize the model via policy gradient algorithms (PPO - Proximal Policy Optimization) using this learned reward model.

**Process**:

1. Generate outputs from initial model.
2. Humans rank or score these outputs.
3. Train reward model to predict human preference.
4. Optimize the original LLM using the reward model feedback.

**Examples**:

* ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude (Anthropic’s models).

---

## 5. **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**

**Description**:

* Adjusts a minimal subset of parameters to fine-tune models efficiently.
* Significantly reduces computational cost.

**Techniques**:

* **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**:
  Inserts low-rank matrices into existing weights.
* **Prefix-tuning/Prompt-tuning**:
  Train continuous prefixes or prompts while keeping the rest of the model parameters frozen.

**Examples**:

* LoRA fine-tuned versions of LLaMA and GPT models.
* Prompt-tuned variants of T5.

---

## 6. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Reasoning-Based Methods**

**Description**:

* Train models explicitly to reason step-by-step, enhancing problem-solving and logical capabilities.

**Techniques**:

* **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**:
  Explicitly prompt the model to reason step-by-step.
* **Self-consistency**:
  Generate multiple reasoning paths and aggregate predictions.

**Examples**:

* GPT models performing math or logic tasks.
* PaLM (Google’s model).

---

## 7. **Distillation and Quantization**

**Description**:

* Compressing large models into smaller ones without losing much performance.

**Techniques**:

* **Knowledge Distillation**:
  Large model ("teacher") generates outputs; smaller model ("student") learns to mimic them.
* **Quantization**:
  Reduces precision of weights (e.g., FP32 → FP16, INT8) to decrease model size and increase inference speed.

**Examples**:

* DistilBERT (distilled from BERT).
* MiniLM (distilled from large transformer models).

---

## 8. **Multi-task Training**

**Description**:

* Train the model simultaneously on multiple tasks, enhancing its generalization capabilities.

**Techniques**:

* Combine several datasets/tasks during fine-tuning.
* Model learns a shared representation beneficial across tasks.

**Examples**:

* T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer).
* MT-DNN (Multi-Task Deep Neural Networks).

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**, a type of **Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)**. Let’s clarify the concept and explain the figure clearly:

---

## More explnataion on LoRA or PEFT:

The figure compares two different approaches:

### 1. **Full Fine-Tuning (left side)**

In full fine-tuning, you modify **all weights** of a model during training.

* **Equation**:

$$
h = (W + \Delta W)x
$$

* $W$ are the original weights of the pre-trained model.
* $\Delta W$ represents the weight updates (delta weights) obtained during fine-tuning.
* This requires storing and updating an entire large weight matrix ($d \times d$), which can be extremely computationally expensive and memory-intensive.

### 2. **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (right side)** (Specifically LoRA)

LoRA proposes to approximate the weight updates $\Delta W$ using a much smaller, low-rank decomposition.

* **Equation**:

$$
h = (W + BA)x
$$

* Instead of explicitly learning a full $d \times d$ matrix $\Delta W$, LoRA decomposes it into two small matrices $B$ and $A$:

  * $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$
  * $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d}$
  * Typically, $r \ll d$ (e.g., $r=8,16,32$), meaning fewer parameters are trained.
* Thus, the effective delta weight update matrix is:

$$
\Delta W \approx BA
$$

* **How it works practically**:

  * $W$ remains frozen (unchanged) during fine-tuning.
  * Only matrices $A$ and $B$ are updated (trained).
  * This greatly reduces memory usage and computational requirements, enabling easier deployment and faster training.

---

## Is this pointing specifically to LoRA?

**Yes**, the right side of your screenshot exactly matches the definition and equations used by **LoRA**. The key signature is the low-rank decomposition $\Delta W = BA$.

---

## "Learns Less but Forgets Less":

The quoted phrase comes from the LoRA foundational paper:

> "**LoRA learns less but forgets less**" means:

* **"Learns less"**:

  * LoRA fine-tuning updates only a tiny fraction of the total parameters.
  * It cannot freely alter every weight; instead, it's limited to a low-dimensional subspace defined by matrices $B$ and $A$.

* **"Forgets less"**:

  * Because the original weights $W$ remain fixed, the pre-trained model's vast knowledge is preserved.
  * LoRA changes the original model minimally, resulting in better retention of pre-training capabilities.

In other words, LoRA strikes a beneficial trade-off between adaptation and retention.

* **Full fine-tuning** may achieve stronger adaptation (more learning) but at the cost of forgetting useful general pre-trained knowledge.
* **LoRA** is more conservative and retains more general capabilities (less forgetting), often making it a superior approach when maintaining model generalization and efficiency.

---

## Benefits of LoRA (Key points for Interview):

* **Efficiency**: Significantly fewer trainable parameters.
* **Reduced memory usage**: Easier deployment, suitable for smaller GPUs or edge devices.
* **Faster fine-tuning**: Trains quickly due to fewer gradients and smaller matrices.
* **Improved retention**: Preserves original model knowledge better than full fine-tuning.

---

## Example Use-cases of LoRA:

* Fine-tuning large foundation models (GPT, LLaMA, etc.) on domain-specific tasks.
* Personalizing chatbots or conversational AI without large computational resources.
* Rapid experimentation where computational resources are limited.

---

This detailed understanding should help you clearly articulate the role of LoRA, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and the concept of "learning less but forgetting less" during your interview.
